# TerraFork

![a 3d terrain](https://kellycode.github.io/terra-js/preview.jpg)

From a fork of https://github.com/spacejack/terra

Updated to THREE r147  
Typescript and its dependencies removed.  
Organized to more OOP standards.  

Terra is brilliant but I prefer to avoid typescript

TODOs:  
Add a gulp builder for minification
